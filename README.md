# Spotify-Clone
Description:
I developed a simple music player web application that mimics the interface of popular music streaming platforms like Spotify. This project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to create responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.

Features:

Navigation Bar:
A navigation bar at the top of the page features a brand logo and menu options (Home and About).
The navigation bar uses the Roboto and Ubuntu fonts for a clean and modern look.

Song List:
A container displays a list of songs, each with an image, song name, and play button.
The song list is styled with a black background and white text to provide contrast.
Songs are dynamically loaded from a predefined array of song objects, each containing song name, file path, and cover image path.
Song Player 

Controls:
Play, pause, previous, and next buttons are located at the bottom of the page, allowing users to control the playback.
A progress bar lets users track the song's progress and seek to specific positions.

Dynamic Content:
JavaScript dynamically populates the song list with data from the array of song objects.
Clicking the play button next to a song loads and plays the corresponding audio file, updating the progress bar and song information.

Song Information Display:
A section at the bottom displays the currently playing song's name and a GIF animation.
The song information updates in real-time as the user interacts with the player controls.

Responsive Design:
The application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience.
